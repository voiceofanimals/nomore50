                           "Shri Narendra Modi Ji,\n Prime Minister of India \n\n It is painful to see the rising incidences of animal cruelty in India. Countless number of animals have become victims of gruesome crimes committed by humans. Street dogs are poisoned, brutally attacked, murdered, cows being attacked with acid, and countless other animals across the country are abused daily.  Yet people convicted of such crimes often only pay a meagre Rs 50 fine – the maximum penalty for a first offence of animal abuse under The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960. Pleas help prevent violence against the innocent animals by strengthening India's animal protection laws and penalties for abusers and setting a clear example. I respectfully ask that you show that cruelty to animals wont be tolerated by ensuring that heinous crimes of brutal torture or killing of animals be made a non-bailable offence and persons found guilty of it receive significant jail time, exemplary fines, and counselling and are forbidden to have contact with animals.\n\nI also urge you to ensure that the proposed amendment to the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1960, after taking into account suggestions sent by NGOs and activists, be introduced and passed in this monsoon session of Parliament beginning 19 July 2021.

                           "Shri Narendra Modi Ji,\n Prime Minister of India \n\n It breaks my heart to see the plight of animals in India. I request you to kindly amend the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 in the upcoming session of the parliment. So many animals have become victims of crimes and perpetrators roam freely on the streets by paying a paltry fine of just Rs 50 for the first offence. This certainly shows that strict laws are needed to curb the rising cases of animal cruelty in India.\n\nI respectfully ask you to kindly take necessary action and ensure animals are not brutally tortured, poisoned and the culprits receive significant jail time. Thank you for your attention to this important matter.\n\nYours sincerely, \n\n",
